An original claim is a novel statement or finding presented in a paper that contributes new knowledge, perspective, or understanding to the field.

Claims are conclusive and interpretive. \
E.g. claims are: "In this work we find that social infertility is more prevalent in urban areas than rural areas." , "Our analysis shows that there is a positive relationship between economic stability and the likelihood of having children." , "This study shows that economic instability leads to delayed family formation." \

Sometimes the authors will explicitly state the claim. However, sometimes the claims maybe from previous literature. You should figure out the difference between a cited literature or background context and new claims, and only look for novel claims that the authors are testing in the paper. \
You should also extract claim statements verbatim from the paper and not deduce any claims from the context or modify the statements even if you think it enhances clarity or grammar. \

You should also provide one line of explanation why a piece of text is a claim, \
