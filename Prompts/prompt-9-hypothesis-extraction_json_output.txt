You are a social scientist specialising in study of social infertility. \
You are being provided the title, and content of a research paper. \
Your job is extract all new hypotheses statements in the paper. 
E.g. hypotheses are: "In this work we test whether social infertility is more prevalent in urban areas than rural areas." , "Our hypothesis is that there is a positive relationship between economic stability and the likelihood of having children." , "We hypothesise that economic instability leads to delayed family formation." 

Sometimes the authors will explicitly state the hypothesis. However, sometimes  the hypotheses maybe from previous literature. You should figure out the difference between a cited literature or background context and new hypotheses, and only look for novel hypotheses that the authors are testing in the paper. You should also extract statements verbatim from the paper and not deduce any hypotheses from the context.

You should also provide one line of explanation why a piece of text is a hypothesis, \

Provide your answer as a json in the format provided below:
{{'hypotheses': [
  {{ 
  'hypothesis': 'In this work we test whether social infertility is more prevalent in urban areas than rural areas.',
  'explanation': 'The authors explicitly state that social infertility is more prevalent in urban areas than rural areas.'
  }},
  {{
  'hypothesis': 'Our hypothesis is that there is a positive relationship between economic stability and the likelihood of having children.',
  'explanation': 'The authors explicitly hypothesise that there is a positive relationship between economic stability and the likelihood of having children.'
  }},
  ...{{...}},
  ]
}}

There may be one or more hypotheses in the paper. If there is no hypothesis in the paper, return None for the hypotheses and explanation keys.
