0,gpt-4o-mini,263CW8WJ,The Effect Of Women'S Participation In The Labour Market On The Postponement Of First Childbirth: A Comparison Of Italy And Hungary,"H1: Given the supposed incompatibility between female employment and family roles, the fertility postponement observed in Italy and Hungary may be affected by the increasing involvement of women in paid work and by their higher educational aspirations and attainment.

2,gpt-4o-mini,263CW8WJ,The Effect Of Women'S Participation In The Labour Market On The Postponement Of First Childbirth: A Comparison Of Italy And Hungary,"H3: Given the change in the cross-country correlation between the fertility and labour force participation rates, we expect to find different effects in the two countries. In Italy, where postponement and female labour force participation rates have been increasing, we expect to see a positive effect; whereas in Hungary, where postponement has been rising and the female labour force participation rates have been decreasing, with an interruption in the late 1990s, we assume that the effect will also be negative.","This hypothesis posits a comparative analysis of the effects of labour force participation on fertility in two different national contexts, indicating a novel investigation.",prompt-6
3,gpt-4o-mini,263CW8WJ,The Effect Of Women'S Participation In The Labour Market On The Postponement Of First Childbirth: A Comparison Of Italy And Hungary,"H4: The literature on the relationship between unemployment and fertility, and descriptive analysis, have shown opposite associations in the two countries. However, we suppose that controlling for the unemployment trends, the effect on postponement would have been the same; Hungary experienced a period of supposed full employment, followed by a peak in unemployment after the collapse of the socialist regime, and then a continuous decrease in unemployment from 1993 onwards. We therefore expect to find that Hungarian women would be, other things being equal, more likely to have progressively postponed starting a family if unemployment increased. Along the same lines, we hypothesize that in Italy, where the negative relationship between fertility and unemployment had been quite stable in 1980–2001/2002, the increase in unemployment may have led to an increase in the postponement of first childbirth.","This hypothesis explores the relationship between unemployment trends and fertility postponement, suggesting a new angle of analysis in the context of the two countries.",prompt-6
