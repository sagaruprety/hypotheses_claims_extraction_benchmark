928,gpt-4o,7759ATPP,Table Of Contents,"Our findings on period parity-specific fertility in Austria lead to three main conclusions. First, the shift to later parenthood has not yet been associated with a declining propensity of women to give birth to a first and second child. Second, recent period parity progression rates are very similar to the cohort progression rates observed among women born in the mid-1960s (see Section 3.2 above). This signals that a stabilisation of completed fertility and cohort parity distribution can be expected for women born in the late 1960s and in the 1970s.
