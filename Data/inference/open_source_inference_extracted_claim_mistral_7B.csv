546,The analysis of adolescent contexts on adulthood childbearing rates makes five contributions to immigrant fertility research.,"First, the early-life childbearing attitudes association to later fertility may be extended to near completed fertility, not just first births as found in the research of Guzzo et al. (2019) and in Chapter 1. Second, racial/ethnic and nativity variation in childbearing rates are only significant among those with lenient early childbearing attitudes. This second point lends support to immigrant fertility subculture theories, because, as shown in Chapter 2, foreign-born groups are more inclined to have lenient or neutral early childbearing attitudes. In the present chapter this proclivity among foreign-born groups is linked to higher childbearing rates and predicted births. Third, the proportion foreign-born in neighborhoods substantially increases childbearing rates for all ethnoracial nativity subgroups, except among US-born Black women. Yet the influence of the proportion foreign-born in neighborhoods is only significant among foreign-born groups. Fourth, the proportion foreign-born in schools affects childbearing rates in opposite directions among US- and foreign-born groups, though results are only significant among US-born Black women. The different effects at the school and tract-level of aggregation for immigrant concentration point to different socialization experiences in adolescence. Notably, the fertility increasing effect of neighborhood immigrant composition across most ethnoracial nativity subgroups likely points to broader structural factors of residential segregation, as has been found in European contexts (Wilson and Kuha 2017). In the US, research finds that adolescent exposure to neighborhood poverty increases the risk of teenage childbearing (Wodtke 2013), but it is unclear how this applied to immigrant subgroups. Lastly, predicted births at the intersection of ethnoracial nativity subgroup's early childbearing attitudes across immigrant contexts reflect the general fertility-increasing effects of lenient early childbearing attitudes.",ZPLDUMG7,"7Kh8Qlyhuvlw\Ri8Wdk*Udgxdwh6Fkrro 67$7(0(172)',66(57$7,21$33529$/",mistral_7B,0.0,prompt-10,55408
