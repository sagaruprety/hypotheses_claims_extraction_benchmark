4,gpt-4o,263CW8WJ,The Effect Of Women'S Participation In The Labour Market On The Postponement Of First Childbirth: A Comparison Of Italy And Hungary,"In line with this approach, we hypothesize that various factors, related to differences in labour market policies, institutional settings, education, and culture, affect postponement behaviour differently.","This statement is a hypothesis because it explicitly states the authors' intention to test the effect of various factors on postponement behaviour, indicating a novel research question they aim to explore.",prompt-6
5,gpt-4o,263CW8WJ,The Effect Of Women'S Participation In The Labour Market On The Postponement Of First Childbirth: A Comparison Of Italy And Hungary,"H1: Given the supposed incompatibility between female employment and family roles, the fertility postponement observed in Italy and Hungary may be affected by the increasing involvement of women in paid work and by their higher educational aspirations and attainment. This may imply that women who work will have fewer children than those who never work.","This is a hypothesis because it proposes a specific relationship between female employment, educational aspirations, and fertility postponement, which the authors intend to test.",prompt-6
6,gpt-4o,263CW8WJ,The Effect Of Women'S Participation In The Labour Market On The Postponement Of First Childbirth: A Comparison Of Italy And Hungary,H2: The delayed entry into motherhood does not affect all women in the same way: those willing to pursue careers—generally those with higher levels of education—may postpone childbearing until they are well established on their career path.,"This statement is a hypothesis as it suggests a differential effect of career aspirations and education level on the timing of motherhood, which the authors plan to investigate.",prompt-6
7,gpt-4o,263CW8WJ,The Effect Of Women'S Participation In The Labour Market On The Postponement Of First Childbirth: A Comparison Of Italy And Hungary,"H3: Given the change in the cross-country correlation between the fertility and labour force participation rates, we expect to find different effects in the two countries. In Italy, where postponement and female labour force participation rates have been increasing, we expect to see a positive effect; whereas in Hungary, where postponement has been rising and the female labour force participation rates have been decreasing, with an interruption in the late 1990s, we assume that the effect will also be negative.","This is a hypothesis because it predicts different effects of labour force participation on fertility postponement in Italy and Hungary, which the authors aim to test.",prompt-6
8,gpt-4o,263CW8WJ,The Effect Of Women'S Participation In The Labour Market On The Postponement Of First Childbirth: A Comparison Of Italy And Hungary,"H4: The literature on the relationship between unemployment and fertility, and descriptive analysis, have shown opposite associations in the two countries. However, we suppose that controlling for the unemployment trends, the effect on postponement would have been the same; Hungary experienced a period of supposed full employment, followed by a peak in unemployment after the collapse of the socialist regime, and then a continuous decrease in unemployment from 1993 onwards. We therefore expect to find that Hungarian women would be, other things being equal, more likely to have progressively postponed starting a family if unemployment increased. Along the same lines, we hypothesize that in Italy, where the negative relationship between fertility and unemployment had been quite stable in 1980–2001/2002, the increase in unemployment may have led to an increase in the postponement of first childbirth.","This statement is a hypothesis as it proposes a specific relationship between unemployment trends and fertility postponement in Italy and Hungary, which the authors intend to test.",prompt-6
