0,"H1: Given the supposed incompatibility between female employment and family roles, the fertility postponement observed in Italy and Hungary may be affected by the increasing involvement of women in paid work and by their higher educational aspirations and attainment.

3,"H4: The literature on the relationship between unemployment and fertility, and descriptive analysis, have shown opposite associations in the two countries. However, we suppose that controlling for the unemployment trends, the effect on postponement would have been the same; Hungary experienced a period of supposed full employment, followed by a peak in unemployment after the collapse of the socialist regime, and then a continuous decrease in unemployment from 1993 onwards. We therefore expect to find that Hungarian women would be, other things being equal, more likely to have progressively postponed starting a family if unemployment increased.",The authors explicitly state this as a hypothesis for contextual-level analysis.,263CW8WJ,The Effect Of Women'S Participation In The Labour Market On The Postponement Of First Childbirth: A Comparison Of Italy And Hungary,qwen2.5_7B,0.0,prompt-9,22057
