We therefore expect to find that Hungarian women would be, other things being equal, more likely to have progressively postponed starting a family if unemployment increased. Along the same lines, we hypothesize that in Italy, where the negative relationship between fertility and unemployment had been quite stable in 1980–2001/2002, the increase in unemployment may have led to an increase in the postponement of first childbirth.",This hypothesis is newly formulated by the authors to explore how changes in unemployment trends influence the postponement of first childbirth differently in Italy and Hungary.,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12546-014-9126-4,False
