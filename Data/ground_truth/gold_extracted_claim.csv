0,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless? Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,"According to the findings, events directly connected to childbearing, such as having a stable partner or not having a partner, living in cohabitation or in marriage, have more influence on decisions about becoming parents than normative expectations, while economic factors (such as having a job) have some impact mainly on postponing childbearing, but do not seem to influence directly whether people will remain childless.",This statement presents the authors' main finding on factors influencing childlessness.,,,

Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,"Outcomes of our analysis show that women belonging to the older age groups were significantly less likely to belong to the postponer category than younger women, a result which is consistent with previous research findings [Berrington 2004; Heaton et al. 1999; Schoen et al. 1999].",This statement highlights the relationship between age groups and likelihood of being postponers.,,,
2,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless?

3,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless? Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,Having paid work indeed significantly increased the chance of postponement for women whose employability in the Hungarian labour market—characterised by very limited parent-friendly flexibility—can be seriously constrained by having children.,This statement asserts the influence of employment on postponing childbearing among women.,,,
4,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless? Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,At the same time (because of the highly gendered nature of family practices that can largely 'free' men from adjusting their work-life balance after having children) employment did not have the same effect on men in the context of having children.,This claim differentiates the impact of employment on childbearing between men and women.,,,
5,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless? Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,Living in a partnership significantly decreased the chances of temporary as well as voluntary childlessness (being a postponer or a childfree articulator) for both genders especially in the case of marriage (but also in the case of cohabitation).,This statement emphasizes the role of partnership in reducing childlessness.,,,
6,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless? Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,"Having their own apartment was shown to somewhat decrease the chance of belonging to the childfree articulator categories for both men and women, a result that coincides with previous Hungarian research findings: having one's own apartment is regarded as a necessary precondition of having children.",This claim links home ownership with lower likelihood of voluntary childlessness.,,,

10,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless? Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,"Only 22% of postponer women and 14% of postponer men had become a parent by 2008, which clearly shows that the majority of postponers were unable to realise their reproductive plans.",This claim highlights the low realization rate of reproductive plans among postponers.,,,
11,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless? Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,The greatest obstacle standing in the way of having children is presumably the lack of a stable partner relationship: this is supported by our finding that the women with the greatest chance of becoming a mother in the examined period were those living in some kind of partner relationship (marriage or cohabitation).,This statement identifies lack of stable partnership as the main obstacle to having children.,,,

13,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless? Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,A vast portion of Hungarian postponers do not become parents even at a very late reproductive age.,This statement asserts that most postponers remain childless despite reaching late reproductive age.,,,
14,o1-mini,1.0,prompt-8,79VGGIEY,Who Remains Childless? Unrealised Fertility Plans In Hungary*,"The main factors contributing to perpetual postponement are neither economic nor ideational factors, but a lasting life-course 'non-event' of not forming a stable partnership, characterising an increasing number of people.","This claim concludes that lack of stable partnerships, rather than economic or ideological factors, drives perpetual postponement.",,,
